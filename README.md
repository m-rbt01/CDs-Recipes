# **CHRISTIAN DONJUAN'S RECIPES**
## A recipes website including individual recipe pages for chili, breakfast tacos, and cereal.

This HTML project allows you to practice setting up project files and directories, building boilerplates, and working with text, lists, links, and images. The context used for this project is a recipes homepage that links to specific recipes within the website. Activities involved:
* Write boilerplate structures in HTML pages.
* Include anchors that navigate the user to recipe pages and back to the homepage.
* Use different heading elements to organize the content appropriately.
* Use both unordered and ordered lists to breakdown recipe ingredients and steps.
* Include recipe images specified with relative file paths.
